# Framework-Vanilla-Reconstruction
   The intention is to reconstruct every physical part of the Framework 13 laptop, so that this repo can be used as a resource to begin mods from.  It forks from [Framework's Mainboard](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-13) and [ExpansionCards](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/ExpansionCards) repos, and pulls from [Fraoch's 3D model](https://github.com/Fraoch/Framework-laptop-3D-model).  This project is using FreeCAD because it is open source, and because it's easier to understand than OpenSCAD.

   Another reason for using FreeCAD rather than something like TinkerCAD is because I really don't want to have the output just be a mesh file.  I want to be able to edit and change dimensions or whatever else.  This will be important to fix mistakes, bad measurements, and to allow people to make their mods.

   These are the parts I think we should create models for:

   - Bottom Cover Kit
   - Input Cover Kit
   - Top Cover
   - Bezel
   - Display Kit
   - Battery
   - Mainboard
   
   Here are some parts that I think _might_ be useful to have models for, but should probably be a second priority:
   
   - Speakers
   - Hinges
   - Webcam Module
   - Antennae
   - Keyboard, separate
   - Power Button, separate
   - Touchpad, separate
   - Input Cover, separate
   
   If you think something else should be added, you can either add it yourself or request it.
